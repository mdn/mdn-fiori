# Links

## External links

External links should have the attribute `rel="external"` set. This will then ensure that the external link icon is automatically added to the link as can be seen below.

<Story name="external link">
  <a href="https://mozilla.org" rel="external">
    Mozilla
  </a>
</Story>
